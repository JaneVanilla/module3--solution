      	   	    Chicken soup, chicken stew, chicken chili, chicken breast on salad…chicken in almost any form is great for your health—unless you’re the chicken of course!
                 All kidding aside, the health benefits of eating poultry are plenty. When this fowl comes in a lean breast, it’s low in fat and calories and high in protein, which makes it ideal for weight maintenance. Not to mention that this bird is jam-packed full of essential nutrients and vitamins.
                Plus, with so many ways to prepare this plucky protein, you’re family won’t tire of chicken as a frequent weekly menu staple. Here are the top ten healthy benefits of eating chicken: 1. High in Protein
                If yo   u’re looking for a great source of lean, low fat protein, this bird is the word. The protein in chicken lends itself to muscle growth and development, and help support a healthy body weight and aid weight loss.              
                 2. Natural Anti-depressant
                Chicken, like its brother fowl the turkey, is high in an amino acid called tryptophan, which gives you that comforting feeling after consuming a big bowl of mom’s chicken soup. In fact, if you’re feeling depressed, eating some poultry will increase the serotonin levels in your brain, enhance your mood, blasting stress, and lulling you to sleep.

      	 		One of the most nutritious foods, beef has appetite-sating high-quality protein, which has all the essential amino acids needed (isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine and more)to build muscle and bone. Beef is a great source of B vitamins (vital for brain function), and the most absorbable form of iron (called haem iron), which builds red blood cells and gives you energy. Its rich store of zinc supports the immune system.

               Beef contains both saturated and monounsaturated fat (thought to be protective against heart disease). Contrary to the prevalent dogma, it's emerging that there is no good evidence to support the notion that saturated fat is harmful. Beef from grass-fed cattle is a great source of omega 3 fatty acids, and conjugated linoleic acid, which some studies show reduces the risk of cancer, obesity, diabetes and some immune system disorders.

              Where to buy and what to pay
              Buy pastured beef from a craft butcher who has hung the meat to dry-age it and allow its natural flavour to develop. Guide price: rib-eye steak £24/kg, stewing beef or steak mince £10/kg.

      	 		Americans are eating more and more sushi with each passing year. Not only are they hoping to reap the overall health benefits of fish (including support for heart and brain health and decrease in inflammation, as well as nourishment for skin and hair), but they also think it’s good for their waistline. However, sushi isn’t always as healthy or as slimming as people want to believe.

                The most common misconception is thinking that no matter what you order, sushi is healthy. However, that is not the case. Sushi is the classic example that size does matter.

                Sushi is deceptive, because, while it seems you are exercising portion control, you actually end up eating a lot of rolls — the most popular form of sushi in this country — to fill you up. Your mind thinks that ordering only three rolls is appropriate, but, in reality, you’re actually ordering 18 to 24 pieces.

                Depending on the type of roll, this can add up to well over 1,000 calories, because you are consuming a lot of rice per roll (about one-third to one-half cup of rice per roll). In addition, sugar and salt are usually added when the rice is made. This can lead to increased calories, unnecessary sodium and an abundance of empty carbs.
